Welcome to the Geometric Deep Learning WASP Core Technology
Cluster, a collaboration platform for PhD students within the
WASP program. This page contains some information for new cluster
members. As the cluster is brand new, we are figuring things
out as we go.

All the best,  
Georg (cluster leader)

#### Communication
Make sure that you are invited to the mailing list and the
slack channel, those two are the main modes of communication.

#### Meetings
We will start by having informal zoom meetings approximately 
once a month. The
meetings are listed in the following Google calendar.

#### Zotero
Zotero is an open source reference management
program.  In order to give others a picture of what you are working
on, each cluster member is encouraged to join the cluster Zotero
group and add a few papers from their field to the shared
references.  
How to join the Zotero group:

1. You can get Zotero as a desktop application from
[zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org) or use the
Web Library (see top of that web page).
2. Create a user so that you can use the "groups" feature.
3. Post your username to the pinned thread in our slack channel,
so that you can be added to the group.
4. Once you're in the group, create a folder ("collection")
with your name and add some nice papers from your field.

#### Github
This page is hosted on the gdl-cluster Github organization
page. In the future we might host shared repositories under
[github.com/gdl-cluster](https://github.com/gdl-cluster).
Write in the slack if you have any fun ideas.
